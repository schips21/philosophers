# Dining philosophers problem
This project has a goal to get knowledge about multhithreding and multiprocessing and related problems with data manipulation.

Philo_one   - multithreading and mutex  
Philo_two   - multithreading and semaphore  
Philo_three - multiprocessing and semaphore  

## To run program  
1. Go to subdirectory philo_X (where X is one, two, or three)  
2. Run make  
3. Run ./philo_X (where X is one, two, or three) with parameters

## Parameters
1. number_of_philosophers: is the number of philosophers and also the number of forks  
2. time_to_die: is in milliseconds, if a philosopher doesn’t start eating ’time_to_die’ milliseconds after starting his last meal or the beginning of the simulation, it dies  
3. time_to_eat: is in milliseconds and is the time it takes for a philosopher to eat. During that time he will need to keep the two forks  
4. time_to_sleep: is in milliseconds and is the time the philosopher will spend sleeping  
5. number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat: argument is optional, if all philosophers eat at least ’number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat’ the simulation will stop. If not specified, the simulation will stop only at the death of a philosopher.

## Examples
5 800 200 200     - no one should die  
5 800 200 200 7   - no one should die and the simulation should stop when all the philosopher haseaten at least 7 times each  
4 310 200 100     - a philosopher should die
